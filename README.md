# SwiftUI API Response UI Components

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create UI components in SwiftUI based on data fetched from a given API. The app includes the following features:

- Displaying a greeting message based on the local time.
- Creating a chart using the response data from the API.
- Adding a tabbed view to display top links and recent links from the API response.

## Requirements

- Xcode
- Swift 5.3+
- SwiftUI
- Charts library (via Swift Package Manager)

## Features

### Greeting Message

- Displays a greeting message (Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good Evening, or Good Night) based on the current local time.

### Chart

- Fetches data from the API and displays it as a line chart.

### Tabbed View for Links

- Includes a tab view with two tabs: "Top Links" and "Recent Links".
- Each tab displays a list of links fetched from the API.

By following these steps, you can create a SwiftUI application that fetches data from an API and displays it in various UI components. This project can serve as a starting point for more complex applications involving data visualization and dynamic content.
